// Classes: Basics

// Just like Java the primary tool Scala gives you 
// to organize your programs is the class.

class House {
  // class definition goes here
}

// You can create instances of House with:
new House

// You may wish to give the new House a name 
// so you can interact with it later:
val myHouse = new House
