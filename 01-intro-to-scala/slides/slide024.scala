/* Singleton Objects

  Scala is more object-oriented than Java is 
  that classes in Scala cannot have static members. 

  Instead, Scala has singleton objects. 

  If you are a Java programmer, one way to 
  think of singleton objects is as the home for 
  any static methods you might have written in Java.
