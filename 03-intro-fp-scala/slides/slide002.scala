Why

"Functional programs contain no assignment statements, so variables, once given a value, never change. 
More generally, functional programs contain no side-effects at all. A function call can have no effect 
other than to compute its result. This eliminates a major source of bugs, and also makes the order of 
execution irrelevant — since no side-effect can change an expression’s value, it can be evaluated at any time."
